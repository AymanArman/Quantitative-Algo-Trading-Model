# Planning — Quantitative Algo Trading Model

> **Workflow note:** Phases are defined structurally here. Each phase is refined in detail immediately before execution. The Quarto document IS the deliverable — each section mixes narrative, implementation, and analysis sequentially.

---

## Deliverables

- `model.qmd` — Quarto source (R only, all implementation inline)
- `model.html` — self-contained rendered HTML (`embed-resources: true`)
- `final_context.md` — locked decisions, assumptions, deferred items
- Public GitHub repo, link submitted via email

**Hard constraints:**
- All data via API only
- R + tidymodels only (Python penalized)
- HTML self-contained
- Mermaid diagram of decision flow
- Kalman Filter + clustering both present

## Document Structure & Phases

### Section 1 — Data
Pull daily OHLCV for all 12 sector ETFs (XLB, XLC, XLE, XLF, XLG, XLI, XLK, XLP, XLRE, XLV, XLU, XLY) and SPY via API.
- Training: June 2000 – Dec 2024
- Test: Jan 2025 – Mar 2026
- Handle shorter histories: XLC (from 2018), XLRE (from 2019)
- Explore and visualise the raw data; clean and confirm quality
- Compute all three return conventions per ETF per day: open-open, close-open, open-close — convention selected later without reworking data
- Output: tidy long-format dataframe `{date, ticker, open, close, oo_return, co_return, oc_return}`

*Refine before execution:* API source, handling of missing dates, adjusted vs unadjusted prices.

---

### Section 2 — Algo Dataset Construction
Build the base dataset that all features and signals attach to.
- This is the canonical table — every subsequent section adds columns to it
- Initial columns: `{date, ticker, open, close, oo_return, co_return, oc_return}`
- Rolling returns over `lookback_days` added after Section 3 locks the parameter
- Covers full date range; SPY and XLG included for benchmark columns but not for feature/cluster columns

*Refine before execution:* confirm return definitions (arithmetic vs log), alignment with rebalance dates.

---

### Section 3 — Lookback Period Selection
Empirically select a single universal lookback period for rolling returns.
- Computed in a **separate diagnostic table**, draws from Section 2 `cc_return`
- Run on **training data only** (June 2000 – Dec 2024) — no parameter fitting on test set; all ETFs including SPY and XLG
- Candidates: L = 21, 63, 126, 252 trading days (≈ 1, 3, 6, 12 months); holding period H = 21 days fixed

**Correlation methodology (Chan 2013 non-overlapping rule):**
- All candidates have L ≥ H, so stride = H = 21 days (non-overlapping holding periods)
- Index sequence per ETF × L: `seq(from = L + 1, to = nrow - H, by = H)`
- At each step point `i`: signal = `mean(cc_return[(i-L):(i-1)])`; forward = `sum(cc_return[i:(i+H-1)])`
- This produces a two-column intermediate table (signal, forward_return) — one row per step point
- Run `cor.test()` on those two columns → extract `r` and `p_value`
- Approximate sample counts: L=21→~291, L=63→~281, L=126→~278, L=252→~271

**Analysis 1 — Absolute return correlation (retained):**
- Signal: `mean(cc_return[(i-L):(i-1)])`; forward: `sum(cc_return[i:(i+H-1)])`
- Output table (one row per ETF × L): `symbol, L, H, n_obs, r, r_sq, p_value`
- Aggregation table (one row per L): median r, median r², % ETFs significant
- Note: absolute lookback returns are still used downstream as clustering features (Section 4) — this analysis is diagnostic, not the primary selection basis

**Analysis 2 — Relative return vs SPY (primary selection basis):**
- Same methodology and stride logic as Analysis 1
- Signal: `mean((ETF_cc_return - SPY_cc_return)[(i-L):(i-1)])`; forward: `sum((ETF_cc_return - SPY_cc_return)[i:(i+H-1)])`
- SPY excluded from its own relative return test; XLG excluded from clustering but included here as diagnostic
- Rationale: strategy ranks clusters by relative outperformance vs market — relative return correlation directly validates the signal used for selection
- Same output tables as Analysis 1

**Selection rule (applied to Analysis 2):** shortest L where median r is maximised and majority of ETFs significant; document any conflicts with Analysis 1

**Presentation:** both analyses rendered as gt tables (summary + detail) using project standard color scheme

**Output:** single locked integer `lookback_days` used for all downstream algo dataset computation

### Section 4 — Feature Engineering
Add the four clustering features to `algo_df` (long format), then pivot to wide `model_df` at the end.

**Dataframe strategy:**
- `algo_df` (long) — master dataset; all feature engineering done here via `group_by(symbol)`
- `model_df` (wide) — created once at the end of Section 4 by pivoting; one row per date, each ETF's features as columns; input for clustering (Section 5) and portfolio simulation (Sections 6–7)

**4a — PCA → PC2 → Cyclical/Defensive Label**

*Rolling PCA (daily, not static):*
- ETF universe: 11 tradeable sector ETFs only — SPY and XLG excluded; XLC and XLRE excluded until they have a full `lookback_days` window of history
- Function `compute_rolling_pc2(algo_df, lookback_days)`:
  - Internally pivots long → wide (date × ETF columns of cc_return) for matrix operations
  - At each date t: extract trailing `lookback_days` rows → compute covariance matrix → eigen decomposition → extract PC2 loadings per ETF
  - Sign-align: XLK loading on PC2 forced positive; flip all loadings on that date if needed
  - Returns long df: `date, symbol, pc2_raw`
- Snapshot verification displayed after this step: eigenvector matrix for one representative date (ETFs as rows, PCs as columns) to confirm cyclical/defensive split

*Kalman Filter (separate function, run after PCA):*
- Function `apply_kalman_pc2(pc2_raw_df)`:
  - 1D local level model per ETF independently: true state evolves slowly, raw PC2 loading is noisy observation
  - Locked parameters: Q = 0.001 (process noise), R = 0.1 (observation noise)
  - Returns long df: `date, symbol, pc2_raw, pc2_filtered`
- Output columns added to `algo_df`: `pc2_raw`, `pc2_filtered`, `cluster_character` (cyclical if pc2_filtered > 0, defensive otherwise)

**4b — Relative Strength vs SPY**
- Rolling average return of ETF minus rolling average return of SPY over `lookback_days`
- Computed in long format via `group_by(symbol)`
- Output column added to `algo_df`: `rel_strength`

**4c — Beta to SPY**
- Rolling OLS slope of ETF daily returns on SPY daily returns over `lookback_days`
- Computed in long format via `group_by(symbol)`
- Output column added to `algo_df`: `beta`

**4d — Momentum Consistency (Hit Rate)**
- Proportion of positive return days over `lookback_days`
- Computed in long format via `group_by(symbol)`
- Output column added to `algo_df`: `hit_rate`

**End of Section 4 — pivot to wide:**
- `model_df <- algo_df %>% pivot_wider(...)` — one row per date, columns: `date, {ETF}_pc2_filtered, {ETF}_cluster_character, {ETF}_rel_strength, {ETF}_beta, {ETF}_hit_rate`
- SPY and XLG excluded from `model_df`
- `algo_df` retained as-is for reference

### Section 5 — Clustering
Dynamic monthly clustering: re-fit k-means at each rebalancing date using current feature values. ETFs shift clusters over time as their character changes — this is the core of the regime-aware strategy.

**Feature scaling:**
- Features (pc2_filtered, rel_strength, beta, hit_rate) are on very different scales — beta ~1, hit_rate ~0–1, pc2_filtered and rel_strength in small decimals
- K-means is distance-based so unscaled features let whichever feature has the largest variance dominate
- tidymodels recipe with `step_normalize()` applied before each monthly fit

**K selection — elbow method (training data only):**
- Fit K = 2 through 8 on training data; plot WCSS vs K as a line chart with points
- Select K at the elbow; K ≥ 3 required per strategy design
- K locked once and applied to all monthly fits

**Dynamic clustering:**
- At each rebalancing date (first trading day of each month), fit k-means on that date's feature values across all ETFs with complete features
- Output: `cluster_id` per ETF per rebalancing date
- XLK validation: table showing XLK's cluster assignment over time — confirms it consistently falls in the cluster with the highest pc2_filtered (cyclical group)

**Note — cluster label consistency is intentionally not addressed:**
- K-means randomly renumbers clusters each run (cluster 1 this month ≠ cluster 1 next month)
- This is irrelevant to the strategy: at each rebalancing date we identify the top cluster by its rolling average return, not by its label
- We never track a named cluster over time — we only ask "which cluster is performing best right now?" and allocate to it
- Attempting to align labels across runs would add complexity with no strategic benefit

**Visualisation:**
- Elbow chart: WCSS vs K, line + points, project color scheme
- 3D animated scatter (monthly frames): x = rel_strength, y = beta, z = hit_rate; color = cluster_id; one point per ETF per frame — shows ETFs moving through feature space and cluster assignments shifting over time

**Output:** `cluster_id` column added to `model_df` for each rebalancing date; feeds directly into Section 7 signal logic

---

### Section 6 — Portfolio Infrastructure
Build the execution and accounting framework before applying any signal.

**Starting capital:** $1,000,000

**Execution convention — Option 1 (split rebalance day):**
- Rebalance occurs on the first trading day of each month (day T); signal computed from data through T-1 close
- On rebalance day T, two P&L events are accounted for separately:
  - Gap: `old_weights × co_return_T` (T-1 close → T open, on old positions)
  - Intraday: `new_weights × oc_return_T` (T open → T close, on new positions)
  - Intermediate `pv_open` computed as transient variable; not stored as a column
- Non-rebalance days: `weights × cc_return` (close-to-close)
- `portfolio_value` column always represents end-of-day (close) value — single column, no split needed

**First rebalance:**
- Deploy $1,000,000 on first trading day of Jan 2025
- Signal computed using last 63 days of training data (Oct–Dec 2024) as the lookback window
- No warm-up period consumed from the test set — training data provides it
- Model fitting boundary unchanged: June 2000 – Dec 2024

**Rebalance sequence:**
  1. Compute `pv_open = pv_yesterday_close × (1 + sum(old_weights × co_return_T))`
  2. Compute new target weights from signal (Section 7)
  3. `new_weights × pv_open` → target values per ETF
  4. Subtract current values → `trade_value` per ETF
  5. Divide by open price → `quantity` to buy/sell
  6. `pv_close = pv_open × (1 + sum(new_weights × oc_return_T))`

**Assumptions (state explicitly in document):**
- Full execution at open price on rebalance day; zero market impact; zero transaction costs
- Cash positions earn 0% — no risk-free rate applied

**Per-ETF columns:** `weight`, `value`, `trade_value`, `quantity`
**Portfolio-level columns:** `portfolio_value` (end-of-day close), `daily_return`

Output: portfolio accounting table ready to receive signals.

### Section 7 — Signal Rules + Simulation
Apply momentum signal logic and simulate the strategy over the test set.

**Cluster ranking:**
- Equal-weighted rolling average `cc_return` over `lookback_days = 63` per cluster
- Top cluster = highest average return (can be negative — see edge case below)

**Rotation buffer:**
- Only rotate to a new top cluster if it outperforms the current cluster by > 0.5% (tentative; noted in document)
- On first rebalance (no prior cluster): no buffer applied

**ETF ranking within top cluster:**
- Rank constituent ETFs by rolling average `cc_return` over `lookback_days`
- Ties broken by symbol alphabetically (arbitrary, consistent)

**Weight assignment:**
- Inverse rank weighting: `weight_i = (1 / rank_i) / sum(1 / rank_j)` for positive-return ETFs only
- ETFs with non-positive rolling average return receive `weight = 0`
- Weights renormalised to sum to 1 across positive-return ETFs

**All-negative edge case (Option A — implicit cash):**
- If all ETFs in the top cluster have non-positive rolling average return, all weights = 0
- Portfolio holds 100% cash for that period; earns 0%
- This is a natural consequence of the weighting rule — no separate mechanism needed
- Document explicitly: *"Strategy moves to cash when no ETF in the top cluster shows positive momentum"*

**Signal:** `signal ∈ {0, 1}` per ETF per rebalance date

**Simulation:** Monthly rebalancing Jan 2025 – Mar 2026 using infrastructure from Section 6

Output: full trade log + daily `portfolio_value` series over test period.

---

### Section 8 — Evaluation
Analyse and evaluate strategy results against SPY benchmark.
- Metrics: annualised return, annualised Sharpe (risk-free rate TBD), max drawdown, Calmar ratio
- Turnover: average monthly portfolio turnover; flag if materially high
- Benchmark: SPY buy-and-hold over same test period
- Evaluate test period only for strategy performance; training period used for methodology validation
- Equity curve plot, drawdown plot, turnover chart
- Discuss results honestly — what worked, what didn't, what assumptions matter most

*Refine before execution:* risk-free rate assumption, annualisation convention.

---

## Phase Dependencies

```
Section 1 → Section 2 → Section 3 → Section 4 → Section 5 → Section 6 → Section 7 → Section 8
```

Strictly sequential. Each section must produce clean, validated output before the next begins.

---

## Locked Assumptions

- Execution at rebalance-day price, no market impact
- Zero transaction costs (stated explicitly in document)
- Long only
- Capital fully deployed within top cluster at all times
- XLK is the PC2 sign-alignment anchor
- Single universal lookback period for all rolling computations
- All three return conventions (open-open, close-open, open-close) computed upfront; convention selection is tentative — determined by specific criteria during Section 6
- K is fixed globally, selected once via elbow method on training data

---

## Deferred Design Decisions (resolve during execution)

- API source for data (Section 1)
- Exact lookback period — output of Section 3
- Kalman Filter Q and R values (Section 4)
- K is fixed globally — selected once via elbow method on training data (Section 5)
- Starting capital (Section 6)
- Rotation buffer threshold (Section 7)
- Risk-free rate for Sharpe (Section 8)
